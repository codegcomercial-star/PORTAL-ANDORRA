# News Placeholder Image

This is a placeholder for news images. In production, you should replace this with an actual image file (news-placeholder.jpg).

The system will fall back to this placeholder when:
- RSS feeds don't contain images
- NewsAPI doesn't provide image URLs
- External images fail to load
